## üìå Overview  
This repository contains the Python implementation accompanying our paper:

> **"Trade-Off Between Interpretability and Accuracy: How Can XAI Build Trust in Track Geometry Predictive Maintenance?"**  
*Presented at RSSRail 2025.*

This study explores the balance between accuracy and interpretability of Machine Learning models predicting railway track geometry defects. We apply Explainable AI (XAI) methods (**SHAP** and **LIME**) to enhance transparency, trust, and informed decision-making in predictive maintenance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Workflow
The complete workflow is documented in the primary **Jupyter Notebook** (`XAI_TGD_LAST.ipynb`):

- **Data Preparation**
  - Loading and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering and selection
  
- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Neural Networks (NN)

- **Model Evaluation**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC
  - 5-fold cross-validation
  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**
  - SHAP (global interpretability)
  - LIME (local interpretability)
  - Analysis of feature importance, redundancy, and model transparency
  
- **Visualization**
  - Results and XAI explanations (SHAP beeswarm, heatmaps, LIME plots)
